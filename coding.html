        <u>Things I'm working on:</u><br>
        <em>~2/9/2023</em> <br>Created and added a DoGooder summary page (just linked), in case anyone wants to learn more about it, or collab on it. Practicing fonts and formatting, realizing there is a lot of HTML that I learned that is not industry-standard. I don't know the best practices and conventions. I include easter eggs and random shit in my old websites, pretty unconventional... that's what made it fun.<br><br>
        <em>~2/8/2023</em> <br>Solved a bunch of JS closure challenges, trying to solidify my understanding of the concept. Using counters and caches in the scope chain of functions to increase functionality.<br><br>
        <em>~2/7/2023:</em> <br>Just decided to make a website for practice. Today, I worked on HTML + CSS: Table styles; STARTING to learn React
