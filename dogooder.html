        <b><u>What:</u></b> Harness Crowdfunding for local construction projects, public spaces; a gov't revenue source; contract with local/state/federal govts to get microdonations from wide net of citizens for projects
<br><br>
<b><u>Pitch:</u></b> <br>
Harness the power of microdonations<br>
How many people in the US?<br>
330-350 million, officially. More, realistically.<br>
Imagine if 1% of the USA donated 1 cent?<br>
$35,000.<br>
Direct $ to local projects<br>
<br>
Imagine doing that 1 time. Amazing, great. Imagine it's on-going, continuous.
<br><br>
Imagine an app that can harness the power of crowdfunding and microdonations for local construction projects to improve public spaces, while also helping its users save time, money, and energy. Similar to Kickstarter, projects will not receive funding unless the goal is reached.

Advice examples: <br>
<u>Save Money = [</u><br>
<em>"For the 64% of Americans who drink coffee daily: keep a french press or some preferred way of making coffee/tea at home, to save money by going to Starbucks/coffee places a little less in the long run.",
<br><br>
"If you get fast food often for convenience, see if they offer an app for you to collect rewards on your purchases. I use Starbucks and Carls Jr. App and my vegan wife never has to pay for her Impossible Burger because I buy enough Jalapeno Doubles.",
<br><br>
"If you know you're going to buy something nonperishable and consumable, best to buy in bulk.",
<br><br>
"Prices of items fluctuate seasonally. Be in tune with the seasons of (prices) by referring to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/the-best-time-of-year-to-buy-everything/" target="_new"><b>this</b></a> link.",
</em>
<br>> Option: no link, just in-app summary
<br><br>
<u>Save Time = [</u><br>
<em>"The line for In-n-Out isn't always long; the best time to go is in the first hour of opening. Or, if you go late at night, you might get a free/extra milkshake.",
<br><br>
"Costco Gas at 6:30am is worth it"
</em>
<br><br>
<u>Save Energy = [</u><br>
<em>"Don't waste time arguing, especially with people who aren't listening.",
</em>
<br><br>
<u>Other = [</u><br>
<em>"Money is one metric; not the only metric. It's the habits that hit your bank overtime that can cost the most, financially. But some habits—such as gym membership—can have a net positive because they contribute to overall physical and mental health, so it is worth the financial cost."
